# Life Simulator Game
## Visual Programming 1 Final Exam Project

This program allows you to create a "Life" and run a simulation showing details of what happens during each year of the character's life.

The Life class contains the Name variable which is applied for the instance through the life of the character.

The "StartLife" method creates a random integer that is divided by 1000 to roll for the possible cases. The method then runs through the starting if statement for the Death of the character, then the remaining case statements.
